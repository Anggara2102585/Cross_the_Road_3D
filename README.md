# Cross the Road 3D

## Setup
The setup is pretty complex, but I'll try to explain it a little bit. First you need to download all the included library on "source_code/config.h" and put them in to your compiler, other than that I think I'm just using freetype library to display text that you need to put in your compiler and tiny obj loader that is already included in "source_code/view". But to make it simple, you can just use the lib and include folder from my compiler that I provided in this repo and put them to  your compiler.

## Build and Run
After all the necessary library are setup, you need to open the main.cpp with vscode then Run Build Task (Ctrl+Shift+B). It will take some time so I provide the exe file in this repo so you can run the program immediately.
